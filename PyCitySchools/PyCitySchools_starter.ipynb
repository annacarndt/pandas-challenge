    "- PyCity School data shows different schools with a variety of population and demographic. The data consists of grades, school size and type, and spending range. Math and reading scores are calculated to determine passing scores.\n",
    "- The highest performing schools are charter schools, which score higher in math and reading vs. district schools. Charter schools almost bouble disctrict schools in overall passing grades. \n",
    "- Small and medium schools, such as charter schools, out preform larger schools on math scores.\n",
    "- Generally, schools with higher budgets did not score better than schools with smaller budgets. \n",
